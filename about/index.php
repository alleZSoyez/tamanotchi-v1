	<b>What is tamaNOTchi?</b>
	<br><br>
	tamaNOTchi are breedable pets that grow bigger as you feed them (also referred to as "clicks"). This project was inspired both by Tamagotchi and the original Kingdom of Knuffel feedable pets. 
	<br><br>
	Please be aware that tamaNOTchi is a highly experimental programming project. Things can and will break at any time. Sometimes, the site may even need to be taken offline temporarily to fix something. However, I will do my best to resolve any problems within a reasonable time frame. Because nothing is guaranteed, tamaNOTchi is completely free to use.
	<br><br>
	If you find any issues, please report them to me either through the Feedback link at the top or via PM on Gaia, Roliana, or recolor.me.
	<br><br>
	<b>How can I get my own tamaNOTchi?</b>
	<br><br>
	At this time, tamaNOTchi is exclusive to Gaia Online, Roliana, and recolor.me. You must have an account on one of those sites, and you must post in the thread (linked at the top of this site) to request a pet. A form will be provided in the first post.
	<br><br>
	<b>Why isn't my tamaNOTchi eating? / Why isn't the Clicks count going up?</b>
	<br><br>
	tamaNOTchi won't eat if it's not hungry. Give it a few minutes and try again.
	<br><br>
	<b>How can I put my tamaNOTchi on my site?</b>
	<br><br>
	Officially, tamaNOTchi only supports BBCode embeds at this time. That code can be found on your pet's profile page. If you know HTML and wish to embed it that way on your Tumblr or something, go for it! I want to see it!<br>
	I'll add official HTML embed codes shortly.
	<br><br>
	<b>How can I breed my tamaNOTchi?</b>
	<br><br>
	Both pets have to be old enough to breed, but the genders don't matter anymore. Pets are old enough starting at Stage 3, as seen in this diagram:
	<br><br>
	<img src="/includes/img/breeding.png" alt="breeding diagram">
	<br>
	Breeding must be facilitated through the respective threads on Gaia/Roliana/recolor.me where you ordered your pet. A form will be provided in the first post.
	<br><br>
	To avoid quarrels, if the other parent does not belong to you, both owners will be required to fill out the form.
	<br><br>
	All requests must be made using the same Gaia/Roliana/recolor.me account you ordered your pet with, or they will not be honored.
	<br><br>
	If you would like to breed but lack another parent, contact me through the thread and I will be more than happy to let you breed with one of my pets.
	<br><br>
	<b>Why should I breed?</b>
	<br><br>
	You don't have to if you don't want to.
	<br><br>
	Your new baby tamaNOTchi will wear a cute ribbon if it has been produced via breeding, and you will be able to see its family tree. Otherwise, there is no difference in functionality or features as of yet.
	<br><br>
	It would be cool to see lots of pets being bred, though. As of this writing there are only two generations. I'd like to see more, so I can add to their family tree.
	<br><br>
	<b>I want to change my owner name / tamaNOTchi's name or gender / tamaNOTchi's colors.</b>
	<br><br>
	Owner/tamaNOTchi names can be changed, yes. Contact me in the thread. Include a link to the original post in the thread where you first ordered your pet to prove it's yours.
	<br><br>
	The color of the pet itself cannot be changed. That is randomly generated.
	<br><br>
	As of now, tamaNOTchi's gender will only be changed under extreme circumstances; for example, if the system is only producing male pets and causing an imbalance. (Yes, this has happened before.)
	<br><br>
	The color of any ribbons is shared with the button colors.
	<br><br>
	The button colors and device colors can be changed. As with name changes, contact me in the thread with a link to your original request.
	<br><br>
	To avoid conflict, all changes must be requested using the same Gaia/Roliana/recolor.me account that you used to order your tamaNOTchi. For example, if you say you were banned and using a new account, or if you are using a mule, I cannot honor any change requests, since there is no way for me to know it's actually you. However, you are always welcome to order a new tamaNOTchi.
	<br><br>
	<b>Hey genius, you misspelled my/my tamaNOTchi's name.</b>
	<br><br>
	I'm sorry. It happens. Most of the requests get filled from my phone, so I am often a victim of autocorrect. Give me a minute and you should find it corrected. If it still isn't fixed within a minute, please bother me so I can fix it.
	<br><br>
	<b>My tamaNOTchi takes forever to load.</b>
	<br><br>
	Please update your embed code. This site has been moved twice, so you're probably using one of the old codes for sk.rydian.net or allezsoyez.nfshost.com. Visit your pet's profile page and use the new (and much shorter!) code listed there.
	<br><br>
	The old codes will be kept active to prevent broken links, but I highly encourage everyone to update to the new tamanotchi.world code.
	<br><br>
	I don't plan on moving this site again, I promise. It's got its own dedicated space now.
	<br><br>
	<b>Some of my clicks disappeared! / My pet is younger now! What gives?</b>
	<br><br>
	This only happens if I'm updating the database... which is a sure sign of new features on the way very soon!
	<br><br>
	However, because this is an experimental project, things may go wrong during an update... including tamaNOTchi anti-aging. But I'll try to preserve as many clicks as I can.
	<br><br>
	<b>Who can I contact about this site?</b>
	<br><br>
	Well... it's just me here. My name is Soyez. I have these accounts:
	<br><br>
	• Scriptkitten on Gaia Online and recolor.me<br>
	• Cre on Roliana<br>
	• alleZSoyez on Twitter and Tumblr
	<br><br>
	You can also leave feedback using the link at the top, but I'll be honest: I don't check it as often.

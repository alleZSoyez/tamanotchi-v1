Currently planning on a better way to differentiate between bred pets and non-bred.
Keep clickin', folks! More features are on the way! ♡<br><br></div><div class="entry"><b>11:59p 05.08.14</b><br>Added three new stages of growth.

Please enjoy! Soon I will add the BBcode to the pages themselves. <br><br></div><div class="entry"><b>4:20p 05.18.14</b><br>BBCode for pets is now displayed on their pages under a spoiler button. This spoiler does require Javascript to function properly. If it does not work for you, make sure you have Javascript enabled and you have an updated browser. This should also work on mobile (especially since I wrote it while on mobile, lol.) Enjoy!<br><br></div><div class="entry"><b>11:43p 05.18.14</b><br>Making it a bit easier to age the pets.

Thanks RyRy for helping me! Also fixed many error messages on the site. Soon there will be actual homepage content.

Two more stages of pet growth added... Including the final form! Keep clicking! &lt;3<br><br></div><div class="entry"><b>10:55a 06.07.14</b><br>Fixed a bug with the larger image.

I will be working to fix this.<br><br></div><div class="entry"><b>1:21a 06.10.16</b><br>It has come to my attention that this still exists lol
I haven't been able to fix the site due to a combination of laziness, a real job taking up my time, and the inability to figure out why this is broken.
I HAVE determined that something is preventing writing to the database, but even after adjusting permissions on the files, I am not sure what. 
Probably some PHP version discrepancy as this was originally written using some bastardization of PHP 5.
I think now that my PC is set up, I should actually sit down and look at this in detail soon.
I am very sorry to everyone who has supported me and this project along the way and have been waiting patiently for me.
I will try to get over this funk and do better.<br><br></div><div class="entry"><b>10:18p 06.10.16</b><br>Removed references to sk.rydian.net... finally. However, existing image links using the old URL will still be backwards-compatible. For increased speed, please utilize the new URL.
Soon, however, this will be moving to its own site. So it may be a moot point. Just gotta decide on a domain name.<br><br></div><div class="entry"><b>10:27p 06.10.16</b><br>ayyyy lmao. http://tamanotchi.world domain is now owned by me. will be moving sooner than anticipated. just waiting for the name to become active. <br><br></div><div class="entry"><b>2:54a 06.11.16</b><br>Test<br><br></div><div class="entry"><b>2:55a 06.11.16</b><br>Ooh! Figured out why writing failed, I think. Just about done fixing this, then, hopefully!<br><br></div><div class="entry"><b>3:17a 06.11.16</b><br>Comments &amp; changelog fixed. (Yes, even the changelog was broken.) To do is fixing the database writing, fixing some minor aesthetic issues, and when all that is functioning again I finally have a concept for art for the homepage. About time!
... speaking of time, it appears this host runs off a different time zone than rydian's. Oops.<br><br></div>
<div class="entry"><b>3:22p 06.11.16</b><br>Minor visual things fixed, stats url prettified, random pet link added to top, HTML validated. Totally not procrastinating on the database fix. Totally.<br><br></div><div class="entry"><b>12:22p 06.12.16</b><br>so, grey is a genius who needs lots of hugs &hearts;
The database has been fixed! <br><br></div><div class="entry"><b>4:08p 06.12.16</b><br>Added &quot;About&quot; page to answer common questions, rearranged top links... they weren't in alphabetical order. It was driving me crazy.<br><br></div><div class="entry"><b>2:40p 06.13.16</b><br>trying to get a testing site working. i have much to do!
i accidentally posted a spoiler, had to move some files around to prevent that. however, the system scripts are unaffected. <br><br></div><div class="entry"><b>10:31p 06.13.16</b><br>fixed about page layout to be consistent with comments &amp; changelog layout. i plan on shrinking the amount of redundant css. need to optimize rando-logo to save bandwidth. fixed broken logo link. current plans are to get testing site working. new species not going well. will shift priorities to making same-sex breeding happen. it was hard-coded to only support one male/one female pairings back in 2014. i didn't want to receive homophobic hate. but, this is 2016 and it's pride week. what better time, right?<br><br></div><div class="entry"><b>10:39p 06.13.16</b><br>oh yeah. i had it fixed for a while but never uploaded it, oops. corrected minor shading issue on some device shapes.<br><br></div><div class="entry"><b>10:49p 06.13.16</b><br>fixed logo. is now two separate images for text and random color image. should load a touch faster and save me some bandwidth. yaaay.<br><br></div><div class="entry"><b>1:37a 06.14.16</b><br>so test.tamanotchi.world is totally useless AND I STILL DON'T KNOW WHY, so testing will have to be done on the live site.<br>
backend changes are in the works. i should be able to get pets out faster with fewer errors. but mostly, it just looks nicer back here lol. however, please ignore pet ID#121. i have plans for them. you may notice their gender swapping back and forth. that's me just fixing the &quot;emergency sex change script&quot;. please ignore this also. not entirely sure, but i think the system is having a bias towards female pets... i'll give it time to balance. but just in case, the sex change script is indeed fixed.<br><br></div><div class="entry"><b>3:15a 06.14.16</b><br>triangle shape is in beta (see pet ID#121 even though i said to previously ignore it). i'm going to bed now +__+<br><br></div><div class="entry"><b>10:28p 06.14.16</b><br>i thiiiiiiiink i fixed the pet editor script... we'll see.
temporarily, all screen colors have been changed to black so they don't make the eyes bleed while i figure out the random color generator for that<br><br></div><div class="entry"><b>3:08p 06.15.16</b><br>fixed wrong parent link on family tree &amp; continuing to make adjustments to the backend. i do believe i've finally fixed it.<br><br></div><div class="entry"><b>3:19p 06.15.16</b><br>added new stats. i think i'll try my hand at making some of these into a graph or chart soon. i love random stats.<br><br></div><div class="entry"><b>3:38p 06.15.16</b><br>added an actual to-do list here rather than cluttering gaia thread, condensed some redundant CSS<br><br></div><div class="entry"><b>5:36a 06.19.16</b><br>testing site is working. grey, you are incredible &hearts;<br><br></div><div class="entry"><b>5:59a 06.19.16</b><br>same-sex breeding implemented. and here i thought it would be difficult lmao. turns out the gender checker was on the same line as the age checker. that was easy.<br><br></div><div class="entry"><b>6:57a 06.19.16</b><br>did you know most of tamanotchi was written on mobile?... well, did you know iOS lacks a tab key, resulting in terribly indented code? well, that's fixed. much better. @__@<br><br></div><div class="entry"><b>9:47p 06.19.16</b><br>since recolor.me can now support it, i have debuted tamanotchi there and updated the documentation.<br><br></div><div class="entry"><b>10:14p 06.20.16</b><br>oops lmao. forgot to edit the footer. fixed<br><br></div><div class="entry"><b>1:52a 06.21.16</b><br>The bandwidth cost is, well, more than expected. I wasn't expecting this much popularity. $2/wk translates to $8/mo which in turn is $96/year in bandwidth... and that's not counting the cost of the domain name (~$40 with taxes) and web space. So I've added a paypal donate button. It would be nice to get help covering costs, but I'm not gonna force it on anyone.<br><br></div><div class="entry"><b>12:20a 06.22.16</b><br>moved donate link to footer so i don't scare anyone off (or break the mobile layout anymore)<br><br></div>
